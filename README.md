# PercussionStudio

PercussionStudio allows you to create various rhythms using traditional ethnic musical instruments - djembe, clave, congas, dununs, etc...

You can compose rhythms using traditional notations or by tapping on the instrument image (mode can be chosen in app settings).  You can even make few instruments playing in the same time, imitating big orchestra!

App is optimized for small and big devices (phones and tablets), for landscape and portrait modes.

It is still an early version, so a lot of expected features are still not implemented (like sharing created rhythms) and there are very few instruments available, plus occasional bugs may occur.
